> **Human Milk Multi-omics: Debiased Modeling with Maternal Factors and Infant Growth across Nations**

This project integrates multi-omics profiles of human milk (HM) with detailed maternal characteristics and infant growth outcomes across multiple international cohorts. The primary goals are to:

- Characterize HM multi-omics composition across countries and lactation stages.
- Quantify how maternal factors (e.g., age, parity, BMI) shape HM composition.
- Evaluate how HM composition directly impacts to infant anthropometric growth.

A debiased multi-omics machine learning framework is used to adjust for covariates and integrate HM multi-omics data across diverse study sites.
## Data

Raw data in this project involve human participants and are not stored directly in this repository. Access to underlying datasets is governed by the IMiC Consortium data-sharing agreements and local ethics approvals.

## Repository Structure

- `src/` – analysis scripts, modeling code, and helper functions   
- `data/` – HM multiomics preprocessed data.
